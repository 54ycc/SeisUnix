@This is the main directory devoted to illustrating normal moveout
corrections and stacking.  If you are new to SU, start by reading
"The SU User's Manual" and the README in $CWPROOT/src/demos.

To run the demo with X Windows, type:
Xmodel     show the model (X-windows plot)
PSmodel    show the model (PostScript plot)
MakeData   make the synthetic traces for the demo
Xdata      show the data (X-windows plot)
PSdata     show the data (PostScript plot)
Velan      interactive velocity analysis demo to build parameter
           file necessary for Xnmo
Xnmo	   show the nmo and stack (X-windows graphics)
PSnmo	   show the nmo and stack (PostScript graphics)
Clean      remove temporary files created by the demo

File to be saved:
model      necessary for the "model" portions of the demo, do not remove.

When you make your velocity picks, you are assuming that the
coefficients were computed as if the model had the constant
velocities (ft/s): 5000.0, 6000.0, 8000.0, 10000.0, 15000.0
in the layers delimited by depths (ft): 0, 1000.0, 2200.0,
3500.0, 5000.0.  However, the modeling program (susynlv)
generates the data according to a linear velocity profile,
here taken as: 5000.0 + 0.002*z.

For shell examples used with real data, see the files Velan,
Velan.nmo, and NmoStack in the
	$CWPROOT/src/su/examples subdirectory.

Notes:
In addition to the above shell files, the demo requires the files:
model, cdp.1500, cdp.2000, cdp.2500, cdp.3000, so do not erase them!
The file stkvel.p is recreated by Xvelocity or PSvelocity.
